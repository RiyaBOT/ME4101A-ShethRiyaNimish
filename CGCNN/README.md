Apart from developing code, the author used machine learning models published in papers to conduct prediction studies. Xie et al used crystal graph convolutional neural networks to directly learn material properties from the connection of atoms in the crystal(https://github.com/txie-93/cgcnn). The convolutional neural networks were built on top of the graphs obtained from the crystal structure to automatically extract information that is suitable for predicting the target property.
