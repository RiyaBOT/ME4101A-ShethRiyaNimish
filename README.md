# ME4101A-ShethRiyaNimish
# Final Year Project


The package implements three different techniques to classify two dimensional materials into ferromagnetic materials, anti-ferromagnetic materials and non-magnetic materials. 

The three techniques are:

- Classical Machine Learning.
- Deep Learning.
- Graph Networks.
